# protoboss
Create interactive prototypes with Grunt, Bower, Sass, Jade, CoffeeScript, and Foundation. Phew.

## Install
```
$ git clone git@github.com:stianba/protoboss.git
$ cd protoboss
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

## How to use
Fire up a local dev server with Grunt.
```
$ grunt
```
Publish the prototype with Grunt.
```
$ grunt publish
```
**Note:** Publishing has certain issues with Font-Awesome. I'll look into it, I guess.
